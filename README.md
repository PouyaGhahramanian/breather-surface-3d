# Breather Surface 3D

## CS465/575 Assignment 3: Realistic Rendering on Parametric Surfaces

This project demonstrates realistic rendering techniques applied to a parametric surface, specifically the "Breather Surface." It showcases various shading models, including wireframe, Gouraud, and Phong shading, and incorporates texture mapping for enhanced visual effects.

### Features

- Realistic rendering of the Breather surface
- Support for different shading techniques
- Interactive texture mapping
- Wireframe mode for understanding the surface geometry

### How to Run

1. **Set Up the Server**:
   - Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine.
   - Place the server code (server.js) in the project directory.

2. **Start the Server**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the command:
     ```
     node server.js
     ```

3. **View the Project**:
   - Open a web browser.
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

Enjoy exploring the different rendering techniques on the parametric Breather surface!
